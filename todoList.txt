The general objective is to get a working version up in the next seven to fourteen days, ideally by about 01/20/2024

Major:

  THIS IS HALF DONE: (add for all work)
  -Save functionality for users:
    +This means saving an array or object to the PostgreSQL server in JSON(?) that represents the data for the object
  -Load functionality:
    +Retrieving the data from the db and using it to output one of the 10 activities

  -Templating development feature:
    +One major issue with this project is that the game / activity components are all very similar and could probably be
    considerably improved with a more streamlined and component-based development process.
    +Saving, input, output, CSS, etc are all areas that should probably be more standardized by using components
    +Another key area is for the GeneratePDF function
    +This also applies to little functions like the word count function or validation

  -Share / Send data to other users:
    +This means allowing other users access to your files
    +Or it may simply mean a search functionality that allows all users to access all files?

  -Add fullscreen support for games

Minor:
  -Fix delete on save page so users cannot click twice
  -Fix extra page on PDF exports
  -Consistent styling for Save, Reset, DownloadPDF buttons
    -Handle ref in parent components?
  -Clean up styles and redundant classes in components
  -More customized PDF config options depending on output (eg. crtyptograms length)
  -Fix change in alignment in Partners preview and final version

Luxury:
  -Generative functionality for picture reveal?


Complete:
  -Module index for third party library components
  -SpotIt loading to stop generating
  -Styling for error modal etc.
  -Add 8-10 picture reveal presets to auto populate the links (animals, food, flags, vehicles, etc)
  -Fix minefield button styling
  -Variable colors and better styling for picture reveal (colors change for each image)
  -Styling for spotIt to make it more appealing
  -Clean up placeholder text / development text (maybe?) - or find a way of displaying it neatly
  -Add consistent gray text for instructions
  -Styling for memory game - more colorful etc
  -Add container for all pages matching jeopardy pages
