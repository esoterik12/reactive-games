    +One major issue with this project is that the game / activity components are all very similar and could probably be
    considerably improved with a more streamlined and component-based development process.
    +Saving, input, output, CSS, etc are all areas that should probably be more standardized by using components
    +Another key area is for the GeneratePDF function
    +This also applies to little functions like the word count function or validation
