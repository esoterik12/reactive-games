The objective of this feature is to provide a colorful and engaging activity that has an 8x8 grid of colorful squares that gradually disappear
to reveal an image below. 

There are a few primary features to consider when designing and making this feature:
1. Input of URLs for the images.
  Users should be able to input URLs found on the internet
    This means a form that creates an array of objects
    An input field for each url - max 15 / 20

  Users should also be able to select some default images / setups
    Ideally there would be common categories like: animals, buildings, jobs, places, cities, flags, food, etc.

  Users should also be able to generate images using Dall-E API (expensive!) - this is mostly just for demo purposes

  Therefore, the input object/data should be considered carefully. Presumably it will be an array of objects.
  Each object will have a few properties: url, name, id, seen?, resulotion?

  Additionally, URLs could be stored on the database with a clear name to help save on API requests (difficult)

  Handling images will be complicated as size and resulotion will cause problems.

2. The display component(s) should be able to handle the array of objects regardless of the source.
  This is an important opportunity to learn about NextImage processing
  The images must be able to be cropped to always fit a certain size. 

3. Create a DUMMY_IMAGES array that can serve as a foundation to build the feature around.

4. How should state be managed in this feature? As it is fairly complex, RTK seems like the best option.
  This would be the data store of objects. 

Tile State:

tilesArray: One array filled with 2s (or "hidden") of length 64
indexArray: One array filled randomly with numbers 0 to 63
currentIndex: 0 to 63, incremented each time reveal is made
