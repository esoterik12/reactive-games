overview:

considerable costomization options when it comes to the input:
FIRST: grid size / teams
this will add a lot of complexity to the scoring
teams between 2-8 size and a rotation of scoring
this can be buttons: 6x6 (fast game) - 9x9 (medium) - 12x12 (long) - or custom?

SECOND: input
based on the selected gridsize, generate an input field that accepts" 
  numbers (plus and minus)
  key words (delete all points)
  steal (steal random team's points - other team if only 2)
  switch (switch random team's points)
  multiply (*x)

input should have default entries

input format: object {
  action: "string" // describes: addition, subtraction, multiply, divide, steal, delete, switch, etc.
  quantity: "number" // applicable to certain actions
}

THIRD:
computation may require an external and complex function that uses case switch
