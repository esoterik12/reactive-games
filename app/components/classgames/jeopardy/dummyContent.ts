(tl) Ellen McKnight/Alamy
Debby also thought of people in
villages like the one she lived in as a
child. The people in these small towns
did not have any electricity. Solar
power would work well there because
there is a lot of sun in Arizona. Debby
decided to help these families get
solar power.
To get a family started, Debby helps
them borrow money from a bank to
buy the panels. After they get the
money from the bank, they have some
time to pay the money back. And the
good news is there is no cost for using
the sun’s power!
Solar panels are
now used on
many homes.
